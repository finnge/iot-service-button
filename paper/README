Abstract

The digitalization process is as prominent in modern industry 4.0 as in our day-to-day life.
Our approach to such transformation is a service button that can help employees in various
different contexts to reorder products or building blocks and is also setup with a authentication
abilities. This product lives in the context of the internet of things and can be connected with
different suppliers and other working processes. This term paper will focus on the conception and
development of a prototype for a service button. It will highlight the context of use
by examine the problem space and taking a closer look at the interaction with the system
especially how an extra authentication step can be included in the process. We will also discuss
the choices of used sensors, actuators and authentication procedures and the paradigms of system
architecture. We will conclude by discussing various ethics and security parameters and by taking
a look at possible transformations to a ready-to-use product.
