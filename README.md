## About the project

The digitalization process is as prominent in modern industry 4.0 as in our day-to-day life. Our contribution to such transformation is a service button that can help employees in various different contexts to reorder products or building blocks and is also equipped with authentication abilities. This product lives in the context of the internet of things and can be connected with different suppliers and other working processes. This term paper will focus on the conception and development of a prototype for a service button. It will highlight the context of usage by examining the usage space and taking a closer look at the interaction with the system especially how an extra authentication step can be included in the process. We will also discuss the choices of used sensors, actuators and authentication procedures and the paradigms of system architecture. We will come to a conclusion by discussing various ethics and security parameters and by taking a look at possible transformations to a ready-to-use product.

## About the module

The amount of everyday objects augmented with computing technology is rapidly increasing. This allows to provide or use services of objects through the Internet, for instance controlling a device like a coffee machine or measuring the usage of a vending machine. Due to the growing relevance of the IoT in various domains we are offering a module dealing with its technologies (like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, MQTT, Node-Red, Johnny Five). In this course you will learn about the basics and the relevance of the IoT. During this project-oriented class you will learn how to connect non-computing devices to the Internet following an approach of brainstorming an idea, designing a system and prototyping a product.
